# MAC Changer

This is a command-line tool that allows you to change the MAC address of a network interface on your system. The tool uses the child_process module's execSync function to run the command-line interface (CLI) commands "ifconfig" to change the MAC address.


## What it does
The script changes the MAC address of the specified network interface to the new MAC address provided as an argument. The change is done by running the command-line interface (CLI) commands "ifconfig"

## Disclaimer
This tool is intended for educational and testing purposes only. Changing the MAC address of a network interface without proper authorization may be illegal in some jurisdictions. Use this tool at your own risk.
